# Master thesis codes
All the codes used during my master thesis and the time right after it. Some 
of them are quite similar since I did not used version control before, 
I just saved with a new date when I did any change. 

You can clearly see a progression towards better coding compared to the first months of my master thesis until the end of it. I am aware that I still have to improve a lot, especially regarding being more organized, better reproducible codes, and commenting more my codes. I was learning that when the problems were rising or when I had to redo things many times. 

Right now, I am trying to start using one private repository for each project.
